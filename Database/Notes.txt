------------------------------ ||Â GENEREL NOTES ON MYSQL AND DATABASE USE || ----------------------

USER: root
Database: e_commerce_model


In MySQL there is a difference between function and procedure.

A function has to return a value and cannot return void.
A procedure can return void and is often made up of multiple actions -
for example taking in an input, concatinating with some predefined text and inserting it into two different tables.
