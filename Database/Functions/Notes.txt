In MySQL there is a difference between function and procedure.

A function has to return a value and cannot return void.
A procedure can return void and is often made up of multiple actions -
for example taking in an input, concatinating with some predefined text and inserting it into two different tables.

In my use, I want to affirm if addings are succesful or not. 
So I count the current rownumbers before inserting, and checks if the table has grown afterwards. 
I return 1 for succesful and 0 for not succesful
